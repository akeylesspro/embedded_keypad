# sdk_config.h

## Purpose
Nordic SDK configuration header generated by the configuration wizard. It enables/disables SDK modules and sets their parameters.

## Key configuration categories
- BLE modules (advertising, GATT, connection parameters, DB discovery).
- Board support features and BSP settings.
- Peer Manager (mostly disabled in this project).
- Scanning module and filters.
- SDK peripherals and utilities (logging, timers, etc.).

## How it is used
The build system and SDK modules include this header to conditionally compile
features and configure module defaults.

## Notes
- This file is large and mostly generated; direct edits should be done via the
  Nordic Configuration Wizard or carefully reviewed.
- Project-specific overrides may also be provided in `app_config.h`.
